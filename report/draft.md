# ðŸ§  Dream Clustering: Discovering Emergent Themes in Dream Reports

## 1. Introduction

Dreams have fascinated both scientists and storytellers for their emotional intensity, symbolic imagery, and mysterious logic. This project explores whether unsupervised machine learning â€” particularly clustering â€” can reveal emergent dream types based solely on the text of dream reports.

Using dream collections from DreamBank, I aim to:

- Preprocess and vectorize raw dream texts
- Apply clustering techniques to group similar dreams
- Interpret and analyze the resulting clusters
- Visualize and reflect on what the emergent structures reveal

## 2. Dataset and Preprocessing

Dreams were collected from DreamBank.net using the open-source DreamScrape tool by Matt Bierner [1], which scrapes and organizes dreams by dreamer into structured JSON files.
